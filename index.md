One day a student team member asked - where can I learn more?

All I could say was 'the internet.' A better answer may have been 'wikipedia',
But the skill of finding the right information is a skill like any other, and
it is unfair to the novice to give advice you would to an expert.

This is a place - to put links and information, 
to find "more" about everything that is Sonic Howl.

I hope you will join me here.

### On Titles
- Titles can seem on the surface to be a formal & stuffy thing.
- Titles can be very useful to remind oneself what their part of the puzzle is
- Well defined titles can be very useful in stressful situations to know what you should be doing
  - E.G. Our fire plan names *specific* people to do *specific* tasks (weather people know them is a different story...)
- Stuffy titles can make a group seem more hirarchacial than it should sometimes.
- Silly titles can hurt being taken seriously by sponsors or media
- Wikipedia has a fantastic (in my humble opinion -KC) system for this
  - Each "Service Award" as a wikipeda editor comes with two titles, both of which are valid for a particular honour.
    - EG. 	
      - Experienced Editor /	Grognard Mirabilaire
      - Master Editor	/ Illustrious Looshpah
  - I think this is the perfect ratio of silly:technical for FRC.
