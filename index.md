One day a student team member asked - where can I learn more?

All I could say was 'the internet.' A better answer may have been 'wikipedia',
But the skill of finding the right information is a skill like any other, and
it is unfair to the novice to give advice you would to an expert.

This is a place - to put links and information, 
to find "more" about everything that is Sonic Howl.

I hope you will join me here.
